## Contributing

Wanna help? Awesome! There are many ways you can contribute.

## Adding a new template

We’re open to expanding the catalog of templates to cover as many use cases as possible. We suggest to open an issue for discussion first to make sure your idea is aligned with the project goals.

## Fixing an existing template

Our existing templates should be flawless. Feel free to submit PRs that correct grammar, fix styling, etc.

## Opening issues

Open an issue to report bugs or to propose new features.

**- Reporting bugs:**
describe the bug as clearly as you can, including steps to reproduce, what happened and what you were expecting to happen.

**- Suggesting features:** explain the proposed feature, what it should do, why it is useful, how users should use it. Give us as much info as possible so it will be easier to discuss, access and implement the proposed feature. When you’re unsure about a certain aspect of the feature, feel free to leave it open for others to discuss and find an appropriate solution.

## Proposing pull requests

Pull requests are very welcome. Note that if you are going to propose drastic changes, be sure to open an issue for discussion first, to make sure that your PR will be accepted before you spend effort coding it.

**- Forking the repository:** clone it locally and create a branch for your proposed bug fix or new feature. Avoid working directly on the main branch.

**- Making changes:** implement your bug fix or feature, write tests to cover it and make sure all tests are passing. Then commit your changes, push your bug fix/feature branch to the origin (your forked repo) and open a pull request to the upstream (the repository you originally forked)‘s main branch.
